AS A subscriber to multiple movie and television streaming services 

I WANT to be able to browse trending available titles by genre across all of the major streaming services 

SO THAT I can select an available title to watch from any of the services without having to toggle back and forth among the various multiple apps of the different streaming services.
AND SO THAT after selecting a title to watch I can link directly to the streaming service on which the title is available.
